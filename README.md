Quran REST API

Asalamu Alaikum! | السَّلَامُ عَلَيْكُمْ

This is a REST API that serves Surahs from the Quran - pretty straight forward.

Audio files are hosted at http://devrj.xyz/iqra/quran_audio/{index}.mp3 (*The {index} is provided by the endpoints in 'indicies' in the API*)

&&

You can view a demo of the API at http://devrj.xyz/iqra

NOTES:

1) This is hosted using a raspberry pi - IT'S NOT FAST

2) The demo site loads slower for longer surahs, because right now it loads all audio files at once. Eventually I will implement some React magic to make it a one page app.

3) I plan on adding support to search for specific ayahs and by juz' - <strike>Insha-allah before Ramadan</strike>
